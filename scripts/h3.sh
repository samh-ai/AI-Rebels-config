  # Match krea2.sh here instead of the more conservative defaults this script tried
  # first. Without HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE, xet starts a file at 1 stream and only ramps
  # up over time (docs: default is concurrency 1, max 64; HIGH_PERFORMANCE raises that to
  # initial 16, max 124). On 2026-08-19 that default-concurrency path stalled the first
  # large model download at ~0 progress for all 3 retries (600s each, identical duration
  # each time - not "slow", stuck), while krea2.sh with HIGH_PERFORMANCE has been
  # reliable across many boots. HIGH_PERFORMANCE's per-process buffers (up to 16GB
  # working / 64GB hard-limit) were the reason it got removed after an earlier OOM on
  # this pod's 28GB cgroup limit - but that was combined with 7 processes at once. Real-
  # world reliability data favors matching krea2.sh over the theoretical memory risk, so
  # both the env vars and full parallelism below now match it.

  # Belt-and-suspenders even with xet disabled: HF_HUB_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT only bounds the
  # HTTP read timeout, not the whole `hf download` process, so a stuck download could still
  # hang the script indefinitely otherwise. Same fix as clone_node: wrap in `timeout
  # --kill-after` (plain `timeout N` only sends SIGTERM at N and then waits for the child -
  # if the child ignores it, timeout blocks forever too; measured elsewhere in this script).
  # 3 attempts, since huggingface_hub resumes partial local-dir downloads from where they
  # left off rather than restarting, so a retry after a timeout is cheap, not a full redo.
  # 1800s here rather than the 600s the other configs use. This queue's two big files are
  # 19.5GB (the diffusion model) and 14.6GB (the 32B text encoder) - far larger than anything
  # krea2v2.sh pulls - and with 6 downloads sharing bandwidth a 600s cap would burn all 3
  # attempts on a transfer that was progressing fine. Resume-on-retry means the longer cap
  # costs nothing on the happy path; it only stops a slow-but-working download being killed.
